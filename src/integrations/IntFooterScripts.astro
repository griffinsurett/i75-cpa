/**
 * Integration Footer Scripts Bundle
 *
 * Consolidates all integration components that should appear in/near the footer.
 * This is primarily for UI components that need to be at the end of the DOM.
 *
 * Currently a placeholder - add footer-level integration components here as needed.
 * Examples of what could go here:
 * - Cookie consent banner (if not lazy-loaded elsewhere)
 * - Chat widgets
 * - Feedback modals
 * - Any deferred UI that should render last
 *
 * Usage in BaseLayout.astro:
 *   <Footer />
 *   <IntFooterScripts />

// Import footer-level integration components here as needed

// import CookieConsentBanner from "@/integrations/preferences/consent/components/CookieConsentBanner/Lazy.tsx";
